Perm Cases Certification Classification

The Department of Labor (DOL) issues a permanent labor certification that authorizes a business to hire a foreign worker to work permanently in the United States. In most cases, a certified labor certification application from the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration is required before a U.S. business can file an immigration petition to the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) (ETA). The Department of Labor must certify to the USCIS that there are insufficient American workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to accept the job opportunity in the area of intended employment, and that the foreign worker's employment will not have an adverse effect on the wages and working conditions of similarly employed Americans.

In this project, we use machine learning techniques to predict the certification status of the PERM applications based on various applicant factors. And we have implemented the model using plotly dashboard which will simulate the live demo. 

The "permcasecopy.py" file is the main file that needs to to run; and the other "ModelComparison.py" file is where we compared the model. Also, while doing this project all the files are also uploaded to google cloud bucket storage and the codes are written accordingly. So please feel free to make some changes as you need. All the required files are also uploaded to this github.

Thank you !!!
